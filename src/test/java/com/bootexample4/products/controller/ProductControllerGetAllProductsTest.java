Scenario 1: Test to verify if getAllProducts returns all products correctly

Details:
  TestName: verifyAllProductsReturnedCorrectly
  Description: This test is meant to check that the getAllProducts method returns the correct list of all products present in the product repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to return a predefined list of products when findAll() method is called.
  Act: Invoke the getAllProducts method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list of products matches the predefined list of products.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getAllProducts method returns the correct list of products. This is crucial to ensure that the application displays all existing products correctly.

Scenario 2: Test to verify if getAllProducts returns an empty list when there are no products

Details:
  TestName: verifyEmptyListWhenNoProducts
  Description: This test is meant to check that the getAllProducts method returns an empty list when there are no products in the product repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to return an empty list when findAll() method is called.
  Act: Invoke the getAllProducts method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list of products is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getAllProducts method correctly handles the scenario where there are no products. This is important to ensure that the application can handle situations where there are no products.

Scenario 3: Test to verify if getAllProducts handles exceptions correctly

Details:
  TestName: verifyExceptionHandlingInGetAllProducts
  Description: This test is meant to check that the getAllProducts method handles exceptions correctly when there is an error in fetching the products from the product repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to throw an exception when findAll() method is called.
  Act: Invoke the getAllProducts method.
  Assert: Assert that the appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getAllProducts method correctly handles exceptions. This is important to prevent application crashes when there are errors in fetching products.
